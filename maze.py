# Vector operations
# These are mathematical operations on 3D vectors. Maybe we should be using

# doesn't handle the w-coordinate specially.)
# Vectors are represented as 3-element lists. Currently passing in a 3-element
# tuple will work as well.

# NOTE: despite the documentation, it is easier to consider GL matrices
# as being in row-major order, with successive operations pre-
# multiplied, and the matrix pre-multiplied to a column vector.
# That is, given a translation T, a rotation R and a vector v calling
#       glTranslate(...)
#       glRotate(...)
# will give R @ T @ v as the transformed vector. This matches the usual
# conventions, and is equivalent to post-multiplying column-major
# matrices as the GL documentation describes.
